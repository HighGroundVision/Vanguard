        We do not just love Dota but Artifact too! Our focus has also been niche tools and this is no different.
        This tool will let you create puzzles with a UI that will guide you through the process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Currently you can create the puzzles and then download them locally.
        This means you can not save puzzles currently.
        We want to add, in the future, a system to save, publish and share your puzzles with others.

        HGV started as a side project of a group of Dota2 fans and it still operates that way. We have a number of other niche tools for Dota2. We don’t intend to make any money from it, although we try to at least break even on the server bills. We’re also happy to share our knowledge with the community by open sourcing our stack. Development is done by volunteers contributing in their free time.
